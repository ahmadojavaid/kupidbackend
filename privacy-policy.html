                <br />

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transaction and once we receive it.

                Member responses to your profile (called Contact Alert);
                Partner matches for you (called Match Mail); and
                Newsletters updating you of the latest features on our site.
                <br />

                Announcements of special events which FindFellow is associated with; or
                Special offers from partner sites or group sites, which we believe are useful for you.
                <br />
                As a FindFellow member, you are automatically subscribed to all of the above, as an integral part of our matchmaking services to you. However, at any time, you may choose to manage your subscriptions to one or more of the above (except Contact Alert). All our emails will carry a link to help you do this. You can also independently manage your email subscription using the My Alerts Manager option.
                <br />
                We reiterate that we will never sell / rent out your email address to any third party, unless you expressly permit us to do so. In fact, we do not allow ANYONE to see your email address, not even other FindFellow members.

                Your friend's email address: Throughout FindFellow, you have the option to send interesting profiles / articles to your friends. Do make full use of this option, because your friends are also covered by FindFellow's spam-free privacy policy.
