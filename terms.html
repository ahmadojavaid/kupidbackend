				<h4><b>Website Visitors</b></h4>
				<p>
				
				Like most website operators, Cupid Love collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cupid Love’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cupid Love’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Cupid Love may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
								
				</p>
				<h4><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Informations</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					Certain visitors to Cupid Love’s websites choose to interact with Cupid Love in ways that require Cupid Love to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cupid Love gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Security</b></h4>
				<p>
					
					The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Advertisements</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Cupid Love and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Links To External Sites</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.

					We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Aggregated Statistics</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					Cupid Love may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Cupid Love may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Cupid Love does not disclose your personally-identifying information.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Affiliate Disclosure</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.
				</p>				
				<h4><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cupid Love may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cupid Love’s sole discretion. Cupid Love encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
				</p>
				<h4><b>Business Transfers</b></h4>
				<p>
					

					If Cupid Love, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Cupid Love goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Cupid Love may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
